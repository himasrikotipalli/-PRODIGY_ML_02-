# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Brief Description

This project aims to implement a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions data into clusters, where each cluster represents a group of similar data points. By applying K-means clustering to customer data, the retail store can gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and segmentation for targeted marketing strategies.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- Gather customer purchase data, including variables such as purchase frequency, total spending, types of products purchased, etc.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

### 2. Choose the Number of Clusters (K)
- Use techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.
- The number of clusters (K) should be chosen based on domain knowledge and the desired granularity of customer segmentation.

### 3. Initialize Cluster Centers
- Randomly initialize K cluster centers (centroids) in the feature space.

### 4. Assign Data Points to Clusters
- Compute the distance between each data point and the cluster centroids (e.g., using Euclidean distance).
- Assign each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

### 5. Update Cluster Centers
- Calculate the mean of the data points in each cluster to update the cluster centroids.
- Move the centroids to the new mean locations.

### 6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5
- Iterate the process of assigning data points to clusters and updating cluster centers until convergence criteria are met.
- Convergence criteria could be a maximum number of iterations or a threshold for centroid movement.

### 7. Evaluate Cluster Quality
- Use metrics like within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or silhouette score to evaluate the quality of the clustering.
- A lower WCSS or higher silhouette score indicates better cluster separation.

### 8. Interpret and Visualize Results
- Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand customer segments.
- Visualize the clusters using scatter plots, t-SNE embeddings, or other techniques to gain insights into customer groups.
